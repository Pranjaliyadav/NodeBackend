const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
 
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function(req, file, cb) {
        cb(null, 'images');
    },
    filename: function(req, file, cb) {
        cb(null, uuidv4())

To ensure that images can be loaded correctly on the frontend, you should also change the logic in the feed.js controller:

in createPosts, change the imageUrl const:

exports.createPost = (req, res, next) => {
    ...
    const imageUrl = req.file.path.replace("\\" ,"/");
    ...
}
and in updatePost (once we added that later):

exports.updatePost = (req, res, next) => {
    ...
    imageUrl = req.file.path.replace("\\","/");
}
