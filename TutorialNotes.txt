const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid');
 
const storage = multer.diskStorage({
    destination: function(req, file, cb) {
        cb(null, 'images');
    },
    filename: function(req, file, cb) {
        cb(null, uuidv4())
    }
});
npm install --save uuid

To ensure that images can be loaded correctly on the frontend, you should also change the logic in the feed.js controller:

in createPosts, change the imageUrl const:

exports.createPost = (req, res, next) => {
    ...
    const imageUrl = req.file.path.replace("\\" ,"/");
    ...
}
and in updatePost (once we added that later):

exports.updatePost = (req, res, next) => {
    ...
    imageUrl = req.file.path.replace("\\","/");
}

npm i --save jsonwebtoken

Module - async/await

Module - web sockets
websockets are established via http
server can push data to client without client making a request
socket.io can be used
npm i --save socket.io

Module - graphql
with rest api - stateless, client independent api for exchanging data
graphql - same as rest just with higher query flexibility

graphql only has POST request. query expression can be sent to define the data that should be returned
define query defination, mutation def, subscrption def
npm i --save graphql express-graphql
https://graphql.org/learn/

call - 
mutation{
  signupUser(userInput: {email : "ts@ts.ts", name : "pran", password : "hellls"}) {
    _id
    email 
  }
}

result - 
{
  "data": {
    "signupUser": {
      "_id": "6755ec91e6392fcac4b9358f",
      "email": "ts@ts.ts"
    }
  }
}
